                <p>Also known as kibble, dry cat food comes in bags and consists of small, dry, crunchy bits. Most cats enjoy this food, and it is formulated with nutrients that your cat needs to be healthy. While kibble alone could be enough to sustain your cat, they have to be able to eat it. Cats with missing teeth or dental issues may not eat kibble because it hurts their mouths. A solution for them would be to soak the kibble in hot water or bone broth to soften it first.
            
                    Many people choose kibble because it’s easy. Storing it is no problem as long as you have an air-tight food container. It’s a quick way to feed your cat. Just scoop out the correct amount, dump it in the bowl, and get on with your day.
                    
                    With kibble-only diets, it’s crucial to make sure your cat is hydrated. Cats don’t drink as much water as they should, and just eating dry kibble further depletes their moisture intake. Adding water or broth to kibble even if your cat doesn’t have dental issues is a good way to make sure your cat is getting enough hydration.
                    
                    Giving your pet the highest quality nutrition is a top priority, so why not give them a food and water dish to match? We think the Hepper Nom Nom Bowl is too good not to share.

            <p>Wet food is a type of food that many cats love. It has an odor and soft consistency that seem to be irresistible to them. Wet food comes in different flavors and textures. You can find it in cans or pouches, and the varieties seem endless.
            
                Chunky: Chunks of protein in thick gravy
                Heavy Gravy: For cats that won’t eat wet food without a generous portion of gravy; also aids in hydration
                Flaked: Usually pieces of fish in a broth or gravy
                Pâté: Smooth consistency that appears to be spreadable, usually in gravy
                Sliced: Long, thick strips of protein in a broth or gravy
                Shredded: Small, thin strips of protein in gravy
                Puree: Food blended with water to form a puréed consistency to appeal to senior cats or those with dental issues; also good as a kibble topper to entice eating
                Broth: Usually in a pouch with a soupy consistency; can also be used as a topper for kibble or other wet foods to entice eating</p>

            <p>Freeze-dried raw food doesn’t require a freezer to store it, making it easier to keep and work with when feeding your cat. It’s a high-protein option, and you’ll need to rehydrate it before serving. This can be done with warm broth or water.</p>

            <img src="../IMG/semi.webp" alt="wet cat food" width="30%" height="30%">
            <p>Semi-moist cat food is similar to kibble, but it’s made of soft, chewy pieces that are usually brightly colored. This is only to attract the customer. Cats don’t care what color their food is, but they like to eat semi-moist food because of its taste. It’s usually much higher in salt and sugar than other foods and filled with artificial colors and flavors. Some cats can eat this food with no issues, but it may not be suitable for every cat, depending on their health status.</p>
